# Nix related stuff

I'm playing around with Nix and recently NixOS, here will be the public part of my configurations and other toy examples on 
my path towards learning Nix.

## Installing Nix

Can be done as simple as:
```
curl https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh
```

## Getting started

[NixPills](https://nixos.org/nixos/nix-pills/) is a great resource to learn.
As you can see this stuff is also inspired by [Sam's blog post series](https://www.sam.today/blog/environments-with-nix-shell-learning-nix-pt-1/) too.

## Motivation

[Domen Ko≈æar](https://www.domenkozar.com/2014/03/11/why-puppet-chef-ansible-arent-good-enough-and-we-can-do-better/) can explain
better than me why Nix is the way to go for package management. Nix is a functional programming language avoiding side-effects.
